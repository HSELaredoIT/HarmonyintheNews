Harmony Public Schools in Laredo, which once served 340 students and operated out of one building, has now grown to three campuses serving about 1,700 students.

The public charter school celebrated its growth Thursday with a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Harmony School of Excellence, located off San Francisco Avenue. The third and newest campus, which opened its doors in August, houses grades nine to 12.

Ever since the establishment of its first campus, Harmony Science Academy, in 2008, the school has been in high demand from parents and students interested in the school's curriculum.

“Our focus is on science, technology, engineering and math education,” said Bilgehan Yasar, area superintendent. “So we like to help the community have that knowledge and prepare students for their careers.”

Harmony Academy is the only Texas Education Agency-STEM academy in Laredo. For students Heber Vazquez and Gerardo Peña, who have their sights set on a career in medicine, Harmony is the perfect school for them. The two high school sophomores have attended Harmony for several years. Peña expressed what he believes sets Harmony apart from other schools.

“I would have to say the opportunities the school gives us because it allows us to learn more than you would in a normal high school,” Peña said. “For example, we are taking a biomedical class, which allows us to learn more about what we want to study.”

During Thursday’s ceremony, Renato Ramirez, CEO and chairman of the board of International Bank of Commerce in Zapata, spoke about his role in bringing the new model of education to Laredo. Ramirez has been instrumental in the expansion, having provided the land and financing for the construction of the schools.

The new addition of Harmony School of Excellence allows more students to be enrolled. Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz, who attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony, expressed his excitement about welcoming the new school. He said Harmony’s holistic approach produces well-rounded students who can become future leaders.

But Harmony is more than just a STEM-focused school. As it continues to expand its presence in Laredo, the creation of school spirit is following closely behind. A campus mascot, Harmony Hawks, was unveiled last year and the 4-year-old athletic department is eagerly working toward UIL participation.

“Today really represents opportunities for us to educate more students,” said Marcy Andrade, Harmony’s San Antonio communications and outreach district director. “We believe in school choice and we offer students an opportunity to really focus in careers for the future, so we’re excited about that.”
