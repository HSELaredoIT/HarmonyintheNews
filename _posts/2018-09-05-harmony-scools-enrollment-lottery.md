	Test scores are not 
necessarily part of the
equation for students 
interested in attending
any of three local 
Harmony schools.
As an open enrollment 
charter school,
Harmony held a lottery
Wednesday to select
students for the 
2017-18 school year.
When the number of students
interested in a specif-
ic grade exceeds the
number of seats avail-
able, names are drawn 
through a random
automated lottery 
process. During the 
lottery, a screen was 
displayed to show 
parents the rundown
of the process,
which included number
of applicants, maxi-
mum number of students
in each grade and
number of applicants
who were siblings of
students currently en-
rolled.
The lottery underwent
two rounds with the first
portion consisting of a
percentage of applicants
with siblings already
attending one of the
Harmony schools. The
second round included
all applicants. While the
random selection offers
an opportunity to all
applicants, Nicole Roma-
nos, campus outreach
coordinator, explained
that consideration goes
to those with siblings
already enrolled.
“We kind of accommo-
date sometimes because I
know parents have a
concern if they have two
kids,” Romanos said.
“Again, it’s not a guaran-
tee. It’s just a percentage
so it won’t be all the sib-
lings. Based on the
amount of people that
applied, they’ll take a
percentage of that for
siblings.”
Out of 503 applicants
for elementary, 95 stu-
dents were drawn to
attend the Harmony
School of Innovation.
Among a total of 300
applicants for middle
school, 284 were chosen
for admission to Harmo-
ny Science Academy.
Once a child is selected
from the lottery, they
have 10 days to submit
documents required to
proceed with enrollment
and a waiting list is de-
veloped for those not yet
	</p>

selected.
“We do encourage
them to remain on the
wait list and look over
the summer for possible
callbacks of acceptance,”
Geraldine Salas, princi-
pal of Harmony School of
Innovation, said.
The Harmony schools
have seen a high demand
in admission since open-
ing their doors. Current-
ly, the high school and
middle school levels
occupy the same build-
ing. But they will soon be
housed in separate build-
ings. The school is seeing
an expansion for the
high school, which is
under construction and
expected to be done by
the end of April. The
new addition provides
more space for middle
school students, thus
allowing a larger window
of availability for enroll-
ment.
After hearing good
things about the school,
Elizabeth Rosales decid-
ed to apply. Rosales had
two children in the lot-
tery for sixth and eighth
grade. Both were accept-
ed. Maribel Lopez, cur-
rent assistant principal
of Harmony Science
Academy, said this year
was the best to apply.
“Usually we only get
like three to maximum 10
students per year be-
cause our students, they
like our academy, so they
stay here,” Lopez said.
“I’m very happy for the
students coming into our
school that applied this
year because usually
every year in the lottery
you’d see disappointment
because of the space.

	“I’m glad that we’re
expanding for next year
so that way we’re going
bigger because our kids
travel from one school to
the other.”
Romanos explained
how the number of stu-
dents selected depends
on the correlation be-
tween availability and
number of applicants.
“This time for the
middle school we had a
lot accepted because
we’re expanding,” Roma-
nos said. “It’s easier to
get into the school, in a
sense for kinder because
we’re looking a three
kinder classes. But again
it’s to let people know it’s
totally randomized. It’s
an opportunity open to
anybody.”
The deadline for high
school applicants is
March 15 with the lottery
taking place March 24.
Principal of Harmony
School of Excellence
Mustfa Ayik said a total
of about 100 students will
be accepted for the fol-
lowing year.
“Our capacity is prob-
ably going to be maxi-
mum 400 and we cur-
rently have 280,” Ayik
said. “The construction
is finishing up and it will
be an easy transition for
us.
“This way, our goal is
to grow our students
with our own school
system. Starting with
elementary them know-
ing the discipline, rules
and regulations as well
as our academic expecta-
tions and coming trained
to our middle school as
well as moving from
there to our high school.”
